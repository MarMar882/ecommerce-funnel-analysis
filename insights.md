# Funnel Analysis Insights

This analysis explores where users drop off in a typical e-commerce funnel:  
**View → Cart → Purchase**

---

## Key Findings

- **96.4%** of user sessions only included a product view.  
  These users did not add anything to cart or proceed to purchase.

- **3.6%** of sessions included an "Add to Cart" action.  
  This is a major drop-off point.

- Among users who added to cart, about **55.5%** completed a purchase.  
  This suggests that the **cart is a strong signal of intent**.

## Drop-off Breakdown

- **View to Cart Drop-off**: 96.4%  
- **Cart to Purchase Drop-off**: 44.5%

---

## Interpretation

The largest friction point is **before the cart**.  
Getting users to click "Add to Cart" may be more impactful than optimizing checkout.

## Next Steps

In future analyses, we'll explore:

- How long it takes for users to move from view → cart → purchase  
- Whether quick vs. slow sessions behave differently  
- What categories or times of day convert best
